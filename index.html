            <p>A portfolio gives you a holistic view of all your assets and enables you to see the gaps in your
                investment
                plan vis a vis your financial objectives. Portfolio management allows you to take more informed
                decisions
                about the kind of investments you should make.</p>

                <p> Web developers create and maintain websites. They are also responsible for the site's technical
                    aspects,
                    such as its
                    performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can
                    handle. In addition,
                    web developers may create content for the site..</p>

                <p> Web development has a number of pros: High earning potential, opportunity for growth, and
                    flexibility are usually top of
                    mind for most who get into the industry. Some of the challenges for people who pursue web
                    development is the competitive
